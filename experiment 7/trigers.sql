What is a Trigger ?
Database Object which is used to log the changes

Uses -> Automate Things, Security Purposes, Log Changes

Example -> Make changes in Employee Table by deducting Salary when Attendance Table is affected as Employee is late on a day.

IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT TRIGGER IN POSTGRES
1. FUNCTION -> TASK will be written
2. Trigger -> Calling the function

EG: FUN_01(Task)
	TRIGGER_01 {
		CALLING FUN_01
	}

3. TYPES OF TRIGGERS
	- TIMING: AFTER | BEFORE
	- EVENT: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE TRUNCATE ETC.
	- ROW / STATEMENT: ROW LEVEL | STATEMENT LEVEL

----- IMPORTANT POINT -----------
1. In Postgres, Triggers call a trigger in PL/SQL
2. DON'T RETURN NEW OR OLD IN "BEFORE" TRIGGER IN ORDER TO PREVENT INSERTION;


------- SYNTAX ------------------

-> In Postgres,
- Creating a trigger Function -> Stored Procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE PLPGSQL
$$
BEGIN

END;
$$

- CALLING FUNCTION ON TRIGGER
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR_TRIGGER_NAME
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE}
ON TBL_NAME
[FOR EACH ROW]
EXECUTE FUNCTION function_name();



-> In SQL Server,
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR_TRIGGER_NAME
{BEFORE | AFTER} INSERT OR DELETE
ON TBL_EMPLOYEE
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN


END;
/





-------------- MAGIC TABLES IN TRIGGERS: NEW AND OLD -------------

For Example:
There is a Employee Table and a Trigger is created (After)
INSERT ON EMPLOYEE(ID, NAME, DEPT) this data goes to -> New Magic Table
Can be used with: New.ID, New.Name, New.Dept

DELETE ON EMPLOYEE: OLD.ID, OLD.NAME, OLD.DEPT


NEW & OLD: References Table; don't exist physically.

Use case: Backup, Restore, Auditing



----------------- IF WE WANT TO CREATE A SINGLE FUNCTION FOR MULTIPLE TRIGGERS ----------------------
WE MAY USE 
TG_OP = 'INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE' -> Tells Which operation is being performed.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE PLPGSQL
$$
BEGIN

	IF TG_OP = 'INSERT'
		THEN RAISE NOTICE 'INSERT OPERATION IS DONE';
		RETURN NEW;

	ELSIF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
		RAISE NOTICE 'UPDATE OPERATION IS DONE';
		RETURN NEW;

	END IF;

	RETURN NULL;

END;
$$

DROP TABLE TBL_STUDENT;

CREATE TABLE TBL_STUDENT
(
	UID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	NAME VARCHAR(20),
	AGE INT
);

INSERT INTO TBL_STUDENT(NAME, AGE)
VALUES
	('PUNIT KUMAR', 20),
	('ANAND', 26),
	('SAHIL', 22),
	('PRISHA', 23);

---------- Experiment 07 -------------------
-- MEDIUM: 
-- Design a Trigger: Whenever there is an insertion on student table then currently, inserted or deleted 
-- Row Should be printed as it as on the output console window.

-- Solution:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION FN_TRG_STUDENT()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS
$$
BEGIN
	IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
		RAISE NOTICE 'ID: % NAME: % AGE: %', NEW.uid, NEW.name, NEW.age;
		RETURN NEW;

	ELSIF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
		RAISE NOTICE 'ID: % NAME: % AGE: %', OLD.uid, OLD.name, OLD.age;
		RETURN OLD;

	END IF;

	RETURN NULL;
END;
$$;


CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TRG_STUDENT
AFTER INSERT OR DELETE
ON TBL_STUDENT
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION FN_TRG_STUDENT();



-- HARD
-- DESIGN A PORSTGRESQL TRIGGERS THAT: 

-- Whenever a new employee is inserted in tbl_employee, a record should be added to tbl_employee_audit like:
-- "Employee name <emp_name> has been added at <current_time>"

-- Whenever an employee is deleted from tbl_employee, a record should be added to tbl_employee_audit like:
-- "Employee name <emp_name> has been deleted at <current_time>"

CREATE TABLE tbl_employee (
    emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    emp_salary NUMERIC
);

CREATE TABLE tbl_employee_audit (
    sno SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    message TEXT
);



CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_employee_changes()
RETURNS TRIGGER 
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS 
$$
BEGIN
    IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
        INSERT INTO tbl_employee_audit(message)
        VALUES ('Employee name ' || NEW.emp_name || ' has been added at ' || NOW());
        RETURN NEW;
        
    ELSIF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
        INSERT INTO tbl_employee_audit(message)
        VALUES ('Employee name ' || OLD.emp_name || ' has been deleted at ' || NOW());
        RETURN OLD;
    END IF;
    
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$



CREATE TRIGGER trg_employee_audit
AFTER INSERT OR DELETE 
ON 
tbl_employee
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_employee_changes();



--TESTING THE TRIGGER
-- Insert an employee
INSERT INTO tbl_employee(emp_name, emp_salary) VALUES ('Aman', 50000);

-- Delete an employee
DELETE FROM tbl_employee WHERE emp_name = 'Aman';

-- Check audit log
SELECT * FROM tbl_employee_audit;
